Welcome to the PSL software Wiki!

## Getting Started with Probabilistic Soft Logic 
To get started with PSL you can follow one of these guides: 
- [Command Line Interface for New Users](Using-the-CLI.md): The Command Line Interface (CLI) will be sufficient for most use cases and we recommend that all users start with it. It is the easiest way to get started with PSL. If you need to take advantage of more advanced / low-level PSL features, then you can move to the Groovy interface.

- [Groovy for Intermediate Users](Using-the-Groovy-Interface.md): If you are comfortable with Java/Groovy and need to take advantage of more advanced / low-level PSL features, then we recommend that you use our Groovy interface. 

PSL requires Java, so before you start make sure that you have [Java](Prerequisites.md) installed. 

## Learning More About PSL
Probabilistic soft logic (PSL) is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models.
PSL models are easy to use and fast.
You can define models using a straightforward logical syntax and solve them with fast convex optimization.
PSL has produced state-of-the-art results in many areas spanning natural language processing, social-network analysis, knowledge graphs, recommender system, and computational biology.
