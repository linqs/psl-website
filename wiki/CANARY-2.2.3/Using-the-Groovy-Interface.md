### Setup
Ensure that you have the [prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) installed.

### Examples
Looking at the [examples](Examples.md) is a great way to get familiar with the Groovy interface.
We also have an [in depth walkthrough](Example-Walkthrough.md) of one of our examples.

### Project Setup
After you have looked at the examples, you should [set up a new PSL project](Creating-a-New-Project.md).
You can [run a PSL Groovy program](Running-a-Program.md) in the same way that you run an example program.

### Groovy Specifics
Here are some more detailed topics that you may need:
- [Rule Specification](Rule-Specification-in-Groovy.md)
- [Logging](Logging.md)
