Before working with PSL, you must make sure that your working environment is properly setup.
- Ensure that you have all the [prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) installed.
- Make sure you are familiar with [using Git](Using-Git.md).
- [Create a new PSL project](Creating-a-new-project.md).
- If you are an Eclipse user, see how to [integrate Eclipse](Eclipse-integration.md).
- If you are working with legacy code, you may need to [switch the PSL version your program uses](Switching-the-PSL-version-your-program-uses.md).
