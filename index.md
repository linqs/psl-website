Probabilistic soft logic (PSL) is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models.
PSL models are easy to use and fast.
You can define models using a straightforward logical syntax and solve them with fast convex optimization.
PSL has produced state-of-the-art results in many areas spanning natural language processing, social-network analysis, knowledge graphs, recommender system, and computational biology.
The PSL framework is available as an [Apache-licensed](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), open source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/linqs/psl) with an active [user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psl-users) for support.
