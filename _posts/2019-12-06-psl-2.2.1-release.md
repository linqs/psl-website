## **Infrastructure**
The 2.2.1 release comes with a few changes to the PSL development cycle and artifact deployment.

### Artifacts Moved to Maven Central
Starting with this release, PSL releases and artifacts will now be hosted through [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central).
Maven Central is the default remote repository for Maven.
With PSL deployed there, there is no longer a need to use the old Maven repository at:
<http://maven.linqs.org/maven/repositories/psl-releases/>.
Old builds will continue to be hosted at the old repository for the foreseeable future.
To find the new builds you can go to the [org.linqs](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.linqs) group on Maven Central.
The development versions are labeled as `CANARY` releases.

Because PSL is now hosted on Maven central,
you can now remove the [maven.linqs.org](http://maven.linqs.org) repository from your Maven configuration.
In most cases, this means that you can remove the following section from your `pom.xml` files:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>daily</updatePolicy>
            <checksumPolicy>fail</checksumPolicy>
        </releases>
        <id>psl-releases</id>
        <name>PSL Releases</name>
        <url>http://maven.linqs.org/maven/repositories/psl-releases/</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

### Wiki Hosted on psl.linqs.org
The PSL Wiki <https://github.com/linqs/psl/wiki>
and PSL Development Wiki <https://github.com/eriq-augustine/psl/wiki>
have been moved to [psl.linqs.org/wiki](/wiki/).
All stable and development releases going forward will have a version of the wiki available as either
live webpages (for newer releases) or downloadable archives (for older releases).

### API Reference Hosted on psl.linqs.org
Along with the Wiki, the API reference will now also be hosted at [psl.linqs.org/api](/api/).
All stable and development releases going forward will have a version of the API reference available as either
live webpages (for newer releases) or downloadable archives (for older releases).

### Development Repo Now linqs/psl
PSL development has been moved from [eriq-augustine/psl](https://github.com/eriq-augustine/psl)
to the canonical PSL repository: [linqs/psl](https://github.com/linqs/psl).
Any new pull requests should be submitted there.

### Issues Moved to linqs/psl
Along with pull requests, issues have been moved to the canonical PSL repository: [linqs/psl/issues](https://github.com/linqs/psl/issues).
All old issues (along the with their comments and labels) have been migrated to this repository and any new issues should be submitted there.

## **PSL Interfaces**
The PSL 2.2.1 release comes with two new interfaces, and one deprecation.

### New Python Interface
Commit: [*a38cffe5*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/a38cffe5866f070f7db9665b5fa94f4f9d957a44)

PSL 2.2.1 comes with the first official release of the PSL Python interface.
This package is called `pslpython` and is [available on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pslpython).
Therefore, it can be installed via pip:
```
pip install pslpython
```
The source for the interface is available in the [main PSL repository](https://github.com/linqs/psl/tree/2.2.1/psl-python).

Fully implemented examples can be found in the [psl-examples repository](https://github.com/linqs/psl-examples).
Below is a simplified example of the Python interface:
```python
import os

from pslpython.model import Model
from pslpython.partition import Partition
from pslpython.predicate import Predicate
from pslpython.rule import Rule

model = Model('sample-model')

# Add predicates.
predicate = Predicate('Foo', closed = True, size = 2)
model.add_predicate(predicate)

predicate = Predicate('Bar', closed = False, size = 2)
model.add_predicate(predicate)

# Add rules.
model.add_rule(Rule('0.20: Foo(A, B) -> Bar(A, B) ^2'))
model.add_rule(Rule('0.01: !Bar(A, B) ^2'))

# Load data.
path = os.path.join('data', 'foo_obs.txt')
model.get_predicate('Foo').add_data_file(Partition.OBSERVATIONS, path)

path = os.path.join('data', 'bar_targets.txt')
model.get_predicate('Bar').add_data_file(Partition.TARGETS, path)

# Run inference.
results = model.infer()

# Write out results.
out_dir = 'inferred-predicates'
os.makedirs(out_dir, exist_ok = True)

out_path = os.path.join(out_dir, "bar.txt")
results[model.get_predicate('Bar')].to_csv(out_path, sep = "\t", header = False, index = False)
```

In addition to creating models in Python, you can use the PSL python package to invoke the PSL CLI interface directory.
Instead of invoking the PSL jar:
```sh
java -jar psl.jar --model test.psl --data test.data
```
You can use the `pslpython` package already installed via pip:
```sh
python -m pslpython.cli --model test.psl --data test.data
```

Additionally, any arguments supported by the CLI interface can be passed to `pslpython.cli` as well:
```sh
python -m pslpython.cli --model test.psl --data test.data --postgres myDB -D log4j.threshold=DEBUG
```

### New Java Interface
Commit: [*7e305dfe*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/7e305dfea1a0e092b43ece80f4e44f71777ee330)

PSL 2.2.1 comes with a new Java interface.
This interface works much like the Groovy interface with some slight differences.
Fully implemented examples of the Java interface can be found in the [psl-examples repository](https://github.com/linqs/psl-examples).

Instead of using `org.linqs.psl.groovy.PSLModel`, `org.linqs.psl.java.PSLModel` is used.
The methods for the PSLModel class are now explicitly named, instead of being overloads of the same `add()` method.
For example, instead of `model.add predicate: "Foo", ...`, you will use `model.addPredicate("Foo", ...)`.
The full API for the PSLModel class can be found [here](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/java/PSLModel.html).

The Groovy interface allows rules to be specified as part of the Groovy syntax.
However, rules in the Java interface must be specified as a String.

To access predicates in the Java interface, you can no longer just reference them by name with no context.
Now, you can ask the model for a predicate by name.
In Groovy:
```
Inserter inserter = dataStore.getInserter(Foo, obsPartition);
```
In Java:
```
Inserter inserter = dataStore.getInserter(model.getStandardPredicate("Foo"), obsPartition);
```

### Groovy Interface Deprecated
Commit: [*476dfd1e*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/476dfd1e745919dc5a2cef4ac521806eb252cac1)

With the addition of the [new Java interface](#new-java-interface), the Groovy interface has officially been deprecated.
It will be removed from the next release of PSL.
Dropping support for Groovy will allow us to support a wider range of Java versions (instead of just 7 and 8).

## **CLI Improvements**

### Functional Predicates
Commit: [*ac2f9a30*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/ac2f9a30d42951a4c0c9a90ade1edfdce0e2fe5d)

[Functional predicates](/wiki/2.2.1/External-Functions.html) are now supported in the CLI.
To use these, a `function` key needs to be specified in the predicate definition, e.g:
```yaml:
  Knows/2: open
  Likes/2: closed
  Lived/2: closed
  SimName:
    - function: org.foo.bar.SimNameExternalFunction
```

In this case, the functional predicate is `SimName` and it is implemented by the `SimNameExternalFunction` class.
`SimName` can then be used in a rule like:
```
1.0: SimName(P1, P2) & Lived(P1, L) & Lived(P2, L) & (P1 != P2) -> Knows(P1, P2) ^2
```

### Multiple Evaluators
Commit: [*d63a8f7e*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/d63a8f7ee1c9bfb881bb53770e3e84db34c2668b)

The CLI can now use multiple evaluators in one run.
This can be done by passing by multiple evaluators to the `--eval` argument:
```
java -jar psl.jar --model test.psl --data test.data --eval DiscreteEvaluator ContinuousEvaluator
```

### Output Ground Rules
Commits: [*62fbd2cc*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/62fbd2cc20c8360c365a02be2cdc4f871a4f5798) ,
[*b901e937*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/b901e937ed2869b5dcc184585ea29c5fa77b1170)

The CLI accepts two new arguments that can be used to see the ground rules being processed.  
`-gr`/`--groundrules` can be used to output the ground rules **before** inference is run.
This will show the ground rules as early as possible.
While `--satisfaction` will output ground rules along with their satisfaction value **after** inference is run.

If you are concerned about an issue with your rules/data and want to see the ground rules created,
then `--groundrules` is the option you should use.
If you are curious about the value that different rules are taking,
then `--satisfaction` is the option you should use.

Either option can be specified without arguments, and the results will be output to stdout.
You can also specify an optional path with either argument and the results will be output there.

### Skip Database Commit
Commit: [*3ced4b20*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/3ced4b20be80fc17403663fe16e194bcfcaf6a3a)

If you do not need the results of inference saved into the database,
then you can save time by skipping the writing of results to the database using the `--skipAtomCommit` argument.

### Remove Extra Quoting
Commit: [*cbe7fd8a*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/cbe7fd8a3c8e5dc9a296836f5574e98353328323)

Constants are no longer quoted in the inferred predicate output produced by the CLI.
This may break existing scripts that parse this output,
but now files output by the CLI will match the format consumed by the CLI (by default).

### run.sh Takes Arguments

The `run.sh` scripts in CLI implementations for `psl-examples` now takes arguments that are passed directly to the CLI.
Specifying these arguments is equivalent to adding these arguments to the `ADDITIONAL_PSL_OPTIONS` constant.
For example:
```
./run.sh -D log4j.threshold=DEBUG --postgres psl
```

## **Performance**

### Reduced Memory

A lot of effort was put into reducing the memory burden of PSL for the 2.2.1 release.
Both in terms of allocations and total persisted memory.
We have observed the total memory consumption in PSL drop between 17.5% and 45.7% (depending on the exact model and data).
Below you can see an example of the same model and data in PSL 2.1.0 (left) vs PSL 2.2.1 (right).
The blue portion of the graph is the actual memory being used.

### Smaller Types
Commit: [*9a34ce23*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/9a34ce235b65cd549c28b9b64cbc94a496d1350c)

Where possible, standard types have been replaced by their shorter sibling
(`int` replaced with `short`, `double` replaced with `float`, etc).
This allows us to trade unused precision for memory and speed (depending on the system architecture).

### Matrix Operations
Commit: [*8f034fa8*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/8f034fa8315d3f6461cd38435612d889c745f4a2)

We have added the [`FloatMatrix`](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/util/FloatMatrix.html) class to handle low-level matrix operations.
This classes uses the [Netlib library](https://www.netlib.org/) to call into the low-level [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) and [LAPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK) libraries.
This allows us to easily perform efficient matrix operations.

### Streaming Grounding Results
Commit: [*8f4de846*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/8f4de8464b79ace097ad577dff0bcbfa63369b3e)

Grounding results can now be streamed from the database using the [`QueryResultIterable`](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/database/QueryResultIterable.html) class.
This allows the user to iterate through the grounding results without needing to keep them all in memory at the same time.

### Runtime Statistics
Commit: [*df58a390*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/df58a390181a1f32ef536674e56e92d20d2257e0)

A new class, [RuntimeStats](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/util/RuntimeStats.html),
has been introduced to keep track of JVM statistics throughout the lifetime of a PSL program.
Setting the configuration option `runtimestats.collect` to `true` will enable the statistics collection.
These collected stats are currently output to the `INFO` log level when the JVM terminates.

Currently, memory information is automatically collected.
In addition, the user can call the static `logDiskRead()` and `logDiskWrite()` methods to keep track of I/O operations.

Using the statistics looks like:
```
linqs@comp:~/code/psl-examples/simple-acquaintances/cli$ ./run.sh -D runtimestats.collect=true

## **Miscellanea**

### Simple Class Names
Commit: [*00b60321*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/00b603211d070729bc486c558846c3cfebcc4bb7)

In any case where a classname is used as a configuration option or argument,
you can now specify the classes shortname instead of its fully-qualified name.
For example, instead of:
```
java -jar psl.jar --model test.psl --data test.data --eval org.linqs.psl.evaluation.statistics.DiscreteEvaluator
```
You can do:
```
java -jar psl.jar --model test.psl --data test.data --eval DiscreteEvaluator
```

### New Weight Learning Method: GPP

With the release of PSL 2.2.1, we are adding a new weight learning method called Gaussian Process Prior (GPP), which is based on Bayesian optimization.

GPP is a search-based weight learning method that works by approximating a user defined metric and evaluating the PSL model on a number of strategically chosen weights.
Although GPP tends to work better with a smoother metric, it can work well with any metric.
The best metric to use depends on the specific problem being modeled.
A major benefit of GPP, and all search-based methods, is that the metric being optimized can be the same as the metric that results are evaluated on.
In contrast, likelihood-based methods (e.g. [Maximum Likelihood MPE](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/application/learning/weight/maxlikelihood/MaxLikelihoodMPE.html)) maximize the likelihood,
which may not be strongly correlated with the desired evaluation metrics.
For further details about GPP, please see the paper: [BOWL Bayesian Optimization for Weight Learning in Probabilistic Soft Logic](https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/node/355).

To use GPP in PSL, you need to choose the right weight learning class and an evaluator that GPP will use to evaluate weight configurations.
The class for GPP is [`org.linqs.psl.application.learning.weight.bayesian.GaussianProcessPrior`](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/application/learning/weight/bayesian/GaussianProcessPrior.html).
You can choose an evaulator by setting the `weightlearning.evaluator` configuration option to any [Evaluator](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/evaluation/statistics/Evaluator.html).

For example, you can use the following command to use GPP in the CLI:
```
./run.sh --learn GaussianProcessPrior -D weightlearning.evaluator=DiscreteEvaluator
```

GPP has four main configuration options that the user should be aware of:
* `weightlearning.evaluator`  
Domain: Any [Evaluator](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/evaluation/statistics/Evaluator.html)  
Default: [ContinuousEvaluator](/api/2.2.1/org/linqs/psl/evaluation/statistics/ContinuousEvaluator.html)  
The user defined metric function that GPP uses to evaluate and optimize weights.
The best evaluator to use depends on your specific problem.

* `gpp.maxiterations`  
Domain: Integer in (0, ∞)  
Default: 25  
The maximum number of times that BOWL will conduct evaluations before choosing the best set of weights.
100 iterations is typically enough for even difficult domains.
Keep in mind that the time taken to perform full learning in BOWL grows quadratically with the number of iterations.
Therefore, if you choose a large number (such as 500), learning might take days to finish.

* `gpp.explore`  
Domain: Float in (0.0, ∞)  
Default: 2.0  
This determines how the weights will be chosen for evaluation.
A lower value implies that the weights chosen for evaluation will be clustered around one region whereas a higher value will lead to exploration of weights that are as distinct as possible.

* `gppker.reldep`  
Domain: Float in (0.0, ∞)  
Default: 1.0  
The relative dependence value given in GPP.
The exploration space increases as the number of rules in the model increase.
A smaller value would imply that weights are very distinct and related, hence requiring fewer iterations.

### Made Data Loading Errors More Clear
Commit: [*1e889f49*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/1e889f49d23ebc438e581fec8a092e50526d9550)

File paths were added to several data loading errors to make them more clear.

### Removed Date ConstantType
Commit: [*df5e1b64*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/df5e1b641d5274dd590bc2a917259a9e38bed464)

The `ConstantType.Date` type have been removed as predicate argument type.
Instead, users should use `ConstantType.String` with the date represented as a string (we suggest [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)),
or users should use `ConstantType.Integer` and represent the date as an [Unix/Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
