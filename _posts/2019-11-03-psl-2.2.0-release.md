We are happy to announce the release of PSL version `2.2.0`!
We have made great improvements to PSL in the areas of usability and performance.

Here you will find a list of the major changes in `2.2.0` as well as information on migrating from `2.1.0`.

For those of you that learn better by example, check out the [PSL examples repository](https://github.com/linqs/psl-examples).
The `master` branch is always compatible with the most resent stable release,
while the `develop` branch stays up-to-date with our development work.

## Infrastructure

### Artifacts Moved to Maven Central

### Wiki Hosted on psl.linqs.org

### Development Repo Now linqs/psl

### Issues Moved to linqs/psl


## PSL Interfaces

### New Python Interface
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/a38cffe5866f070f7db9665b5fa94f4f9d957a44)
Added python interface
The PSL CLI can now be invoked using Python! The package is available on `pip` as `pslpython` and can be installed via `pip install pslpython`. For examples of using the python interface, refer to the [psl-examples repository](https://github.com/linqs/psl-examples/tree/develop).

### New Java Interface
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/7e305dfea1a0e092b43ece80f4e44f71777ee330)
Pure Java interface  
### Groovy Interface Deprecated
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/476dfd1e745919dc5a2cef4ac521806eb252cac1)
Deprecate Groovy in favor of Java.


## CLI Improvements

### Functional Predicates
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/ac2f9a30d42951a4c0c9a90ade1edfdce0e2fe5d)
Functional Predicates in the CLI are now supported. To use these, a function key needs to be specified in the predicate definition. e.g:
```predicates:
  Knows/2: open
  Likes/2: closed
  Lived/2: closed
  SimName:
    - function: org.linqs.psl.cli.SimpleAcquaintancesTest$SimNameExternalFunction

observations:
  SimName : knows_obs.txt
  Knows : knows_obs.txt
  Lived : lived_obs.txt
  Likes : likes_obs.txt
```
In this case, the functional predicate is `SimName` and it is specified by the `SimNameExternalFunction`. This can then be used in a rule like - `1: SimName(P1, P2) & Lived(P1, L) & Lived(P2, L) & (P1 != P2) -> Knows(P1, P2) ^2`.

### Multiple Evaluators
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/d63a8f7ee1c9bfb881bb53770e3e84db34c2668b)
Added ability to specify multiple evaluators in CLI. This can be done by passing in multiple evaluators separated by spaces. eg: `./run.sh --eval CategoricalEvaluator ContinuousEvaluator`.

### Output Ground Rules
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/62fbd2cc20c8360c365a02be2cdc4f871a4f5798) | [*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/b901e937ed2869b5dcc184585ea29c5fa77b1170)
Added a new option to CLI (-gr/--groundrules) that will output the ground rules to the specified file (stdout if no path specified). e.g: `./run.sh --groundrules ground.txt`.
Added the ability to output ground rules along with their satisfaction either to the specified file or stdout (Use --satisfaction flag). e.g: `./run.sh --satisfaction satisfaction.txt`.

### Skip Database Commit
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/3ced4b20be80fc17403663fe16e194bcfcaf6a3a)
Added option to skip committing atoms to database after inference (--skipCommitAtoms):
Atoms get committed to the database after inference by default. We now provide an option to skip the commits which means that the inferred atoms will no longer be persisted in the database. 

### Simple Class Names
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/00b603211d070729bc486c558846c3cfebcc4bb7)
Allow simple names for classes 

### Remove Extra Quoting
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/cbe7fd8a3c8e5dc9a296836f5574e98353328323)
Removed extra quoting from CLI output. 

### run.sh Takes Arguments
run.sh in CLI psl-examples now takes blind arguments.


## Performance

### Reduced Memory Allocations
Alocations

### Smaller Types
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/9a34ce235b65cd549c28b9b64cbc94a496d1350c)
Shorter types (short/float) 

### Matrix Operations
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/8f034fa8315d3f6461cd38435612d889c745f4a2)
Added a class to handle low level matrix operations. 

### Streaming Grounding Results
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/8f4de8464b79ace097ad577dff0bcbfa63369b3e)
Streaming grounding results from the database to grounding. 

### Runtime Statistics
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/df58a390181a1f32ef536674e56e92d20d2257e0)
Added RuntimeStats 


## Miscellanea

### New Weight Learning Method: GPP
Added GPP weight learning algorithm to PSL

### Made Data Loading Errors More Clear
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/1e889f49d23ebc438e581fec8a092e50526d9550)
Data loading errors 

### Removed Date ConstantType
[*commit*](https://github.com/linqs/psl/commit/df5e1b641d5274dd590bc2a917259a9e38bed464)
