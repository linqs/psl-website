We are happy to announce the release of PSL version `2.2.0`!
We have made great improvements to PSL in the areas of usability and performance.

Here you will find a list of the major changes in `2.2.0` as well as information on migrating from `2.1.0`.

For those of you that learn better by example, check out the [PSL examples repository](https://github.com/linqs/psl-examples).
The `master` branch is always compatible with the most resent stable release,
while the `develop` branch stays up-to-date with our development work.
