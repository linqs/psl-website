* Make kernel computation faster using parallel class.
* Added support for funcitonal predicates in CLI - Users will need to add a "function key" to the predicate definition.
* Grounding (for logical rules) no longer throws a PAM exception unless the ground rule is also non-trivial.
* Streaming grounding results from the database to grounding.
* Table selectivity?
* Rolled antrl to latest?
* Added column histograms for Postgres
* Added a check in grounding that abandons ground rules with no RVAs
* Added the ability for the PAM to not cache closed atoms
* CLI now reuses the database from inference in evaluation
* Added feasibility information to the output of ADMM
* Added ability to specify multiple evaluators in CLI
* Added a new option to CLI (-gr/--groundrules) that will output the ground rules to the specified file (stdout if no path specified)
* Fixed an overflow issue where functions with many terms overflowed the array size
* Added the ability to output ground rules along with their satisfaction in the CLI. (Use --satisfaction flag)
* Added different spaces for computing distance
* Added testing infrastructure and tests for predicates, rules, inference etc.
* Added python interface
* Added GPP weight learning algorithm to PSL
* Added config options for ContinuousRandomGridSearch
* Added a class to handle low level matrix operations.
* Added Cholesky Decomposition to FloatMatrix
* Removed last uses of Apache Collection4 lib
* Added an option to ground queries in serial (even when rewriting)
* Removed Date ConstantType
* Moved to Maven Central!
* Added command line arguments for all PSL interfaces
* Added a fix so that double adding a rule to a model does not throw an exception but logs a warning instead
* Added a new rand function for bounded floats
* Added DCDReasoner
* Added full support for streaming SGD
* Added IO stats to RuntimeStats
* Fully deprecated Groovy interface
* Added option to skip committing atoms to database after inference (--skipCommitAtoms)
